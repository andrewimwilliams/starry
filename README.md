# 🚀 Personal Portfolio

This is my **personal portfolio website**, where I showcase some of my work from both my professional and academic career. I built this project to explore **modern front-end technologies**, improve my **deployment skills**, and experiment with **UI frameworks**.

## 🌟 Motivation

I created this portfolio for three main reasons:

1. **Showcase Career Work** – While traditional resumes serve their purpose, creating a personal website provides a more creative way to highlight career accomplishments.
2. **Learn New Technologies** – This project helped me explore **Astro** and **Shadcn components**, as well as integrating **React** into an Astro project.
3. **Improve Front-End & Deployment Skills** – I used **Cloudflare** for hosting my website and experimented with different tools to improve my workflow.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Astro  
- **UI Components:** Shadcn (React-based)
